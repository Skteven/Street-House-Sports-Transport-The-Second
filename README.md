# Cranbrook Sports Transport System

## What the project does

This project is a **digital transport management system** built for Cranbrook boarding students and staff. It replaces the outdated paper-based transport request system with a web-based platform that allows:
- Students to submit weekend sports transport requests online
- Staff and Masters on Duty (MODs) to view transport bookings through a digital timetable
- Role-based logins for Students, Staff, and MODs
- Prefilling of past submissions to save time
- Admin-level tools for user management

## Why the project is useful

The current physical form system is unreliable, hard to track, and prone to miscommunication. This project:
- Prevents lost forms and forgotten requests
- Improves communication between students and staff
- Reduces the workload for MODs during busy weekends
- Adds basic data security and role-based access
- Ensures faster transport planning with easier access to requests
